My T1A3 assignment - terminal app for week 6 of CoderAcademy Fact Track Bootcamp

## Overview

Given the current economic climate (i.e. global recession) is rather dire. And given that closer to home in Australia average household debt is over $160k (the second highest in the world), living within one's means is important to avoid debt spiralling out of control. Many people live paycheck to paycheck and have difficulty budgeting for the future.

This app aims to provide a simple, non-invasive way (as opposed to apps like it that request access to bank accounts) for someone to track income and expenses, see where their bank balance will be at by the end of the week, the end of the month and/or the end of the year. It can help work towards a savings goal or to avoid falling further into debt - at the very least, see where they spend their money.

Whilst this won't solve the record household debt, it may help people with their fiscal responsibility - something that isn't taught in school. I'm developing it because I personally use a mobile app similar to this that I wish had some different functionality. I'm also doing it because I'm not the most financially responsible person in the world and without a clear indication of the impact of my outgoing expenses compared to my income, I struggle to save money. I know many people in a similar situation and believe the use of an app like this would help them avoid debt, or at least avoid crippling debt.
